ðŸ‘‹ Hi There, Iâ€™m Vitor Johnson! 

Welcome to my Github Profile!

I have a degree on Mechanical Engineering that fell in love with data analytics and science!
My professional experience is around the automotive industry under the role of Quality Analyst, where I developed skilss such as problem solving, quality tools (Ishikawa Diagram, Pareto, PDCA, 5 Why, 5W2H), KPI development and client satisfaction. 
It was during this period that I developed new dashboards to follow KPI trends, vital for efficient and strategic decision making. Built up on this new development, I started the search for new experiences and started to learn new programming languages. The next steps are to get a Data Analyst role and continue to extend my knowledges.
